1. A* heuristic only take time into account, rather than x,y,time;
&. A* may have many optimal paths, how to select from those?
2. Different cost in different velocity;

3. evaluation 106th row ?
4. simpleSub sub[len(x)-1:length, 1] = y ?


5.The min is 19370; the max is 72000; the max is 54000 when no crash.


6. The possible data changes of final: start point do not crash even velocity > 15; allow to land when velocity is too strong.
